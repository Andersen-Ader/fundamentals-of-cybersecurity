# Flask Web App

## Overview
This is a very rudimentary and insecure web app that allows one to view a webpage with a form.  The form has two fields for a name and a number.  After submitting the user will be redirected to a new page which displays the form data the they submitted. 

## How to Run
```
python3 app.py
```
This is the command used to start the application, following the provided URL will provide access to both segments the submission form and the data view page.

## Addenda
I did not encounter many issues with this project beyond limitations in my own knowledge of both HTML and Flask.  The primary issue I had was figuring out how to get the form data into the data page but the above stackoverflow article provided all the information I needed.
